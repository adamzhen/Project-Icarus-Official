An interactive website created for the 2022 NASA Space Apps Challenge, October 1-2. Our team of 2 worked on a challenge called [Creative Data Display With the Parker Solar Probe](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/creative-data-display/details), for which we created this interactice website. Unfortunately, the ideas that we had in mind proved to be too ambitious to complete in under 48 hours, so we weren't able to finish it by the submission deadline. As a result, I am currently working steadily to bring our original vision to fruition - that is, a vision of helping educate the public on the Parker Solar Probe's mission through an all-encompassing, story-based experience packed with visuals.
