This interactive website was initially created for the 2022 NASA Space Apps Challenge (October 1-2). As a team of 2, [Warren Wu](https://github.com/WarrenWu4) and I worked on a challenge called "[Creative Data Display With the Parker Solar Probe](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/creative-data-display/details)," but alas, our project was too ambitious to finish in 48 hours. So after the challenge ended, I decided to keep working on it on my own to steadily bring our original vision to fruition - that is, a vision of helping educate the public on the Parker Solar Probe's mission through an all-encompassing interactive, story-based experience packed with visuals.
